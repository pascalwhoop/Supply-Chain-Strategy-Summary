<!-- USAGE INFORMATION

 ## Information

To create this summary there are a few helpers to make work easier:

- first run `npm install -g typescript live-server` as well as `brew install pandoc` or in case of a linux distro `apt install pandoc` to allow live previewing of the created html
- running `npm install && npm start` will watch the desktop for new `.png` files and automatically copy them to the images folder.
    - new images will be numbered from 1,2,3,4,... all ending with the `.png` file type
- to build a pdf from the markdown one may use `npm run build-pdf`
    - please advise: `pandoc` as well as `latex` need to be installed on the system and available in the PATH env variable
- to build a html website from the markdown one may use `npm build`

To install pandoc and latex on Linux one may use:
`sudo apt install pandoc texlive-latex-base`
To use math, just use the normal latex notation.

`\\( f(x) = 2x \\)` for inline \\( f(x) = 2x \\)

and for block size math
```
$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$
```

$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$

<li><strong>How to serve</strong>: approaches of building it by the company. Not competencies unique to company but solution terms for “wants”</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Matrix</strong>: Ranking of factors 1, 3, 5 (size of circle)</li>
<li><strong>Interrelationships</strong>: Relationships between company “hows” (just interactions, unspecified if support or conflict)</li>
<li><strong>Importance Ratings</strong>: Under the Relationship Matrix goes the ratings. Simply sum of factors * customer ranking</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate competitors</strong> regarding wants. G(ood) / P(oor)</li>
<li><strong>Metric based evaluation</strong>: Metric for each “how” and multiple “want”, to accurately compare products. Rate both own and competitors</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/pascalwhoop/17.png" /></p>
<p>This model is especially interesting as it applies the HoQ model to the different stages. Hence for each stage, the wants of the customer are the “hows” of the previous stage: <img src="images/pascalwhoop/18.png" /></p>
<h3 id="stage-gate-model-cooper">4.4 Stage Gate Model [Cooper]</h3>
<p>The Stage Gate model includes the idea of having systematic positions or stages in a process where it is expected of to regularly scrap projects that do not manage to pass certain quality or performance criteria (Go/Kill decisions). The decisions are made by a team of <em>gatekeepers</em> from management, who are resource owners, but are not as involved as the project managers. This really is common sense but it is required as humans tend to be biased towards wanting to do too much (project falacy) and feel the need to pull through with rationally failed projects (sunk cost falacy, confirmation bias, …)</p>
<h2 id="chapters-5-6-simulation">Chapters 5 &amp; 6: Simulation</h2>
<p>The simulation was very similar to the second paper of chapter 9, which looks at how to balance near and offshore manufacturing. However, the paper defined correlation between supply and demand. In the simulation, the supply was not fluctuating but fixed and reliable.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7-capacity-strategy">Chapter 7: Capacity Strategy</h2>
<p>The topic of this chapter is the process of deciding the long term requirements for capacity sizes as well as time and location. While the scope is “long term”, the decision process for the size is very similar to that of the newsvendor problem. One has to evaluate both the costs that one incurrs in the case of an investment into new capacity and the expected benefits (income) one might get in return. This is abstracted by an expected demand distribution. The timing tradeoff is that of gitadditional demand distribution information (i.e. a smaller standard deviation) vs. the risk of lost sales opportunities while waiting. The location tradeoff is that of costs versus a service level fulfillment ability. The closer the manufacturing is, the easier it is to fulfill all demand, achieving a high service level.</p>
<p><strong>Def: Capacity</strong> in the static, physical sense, means the <em>scale</em> of an operation</p>
<p><strong>Key determinants of capacity strategy include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Demand Growth Curve</li>
<li>Demand Growth Curve</li>
<li>Uncertainty</li>
<li>Scale Economies (Capacity &amp; Production)</li>
<li>Time Value of Money</li>
<li>Learning Curves</li>
<li>Technology Roadmaps</li>
<li>Access to Capital</li>
<li>Supply Base</li>
<li>Customer Stickiness</li>
<li>Competitor Actions</li>

<p><strong>Capacity frictions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lead times</li>
<li>Lumpiness</li>
<li>Irreversibility</li>
<li>(Demand) Uncertainty</li>
<li>Scale economics</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/pascalwhoop/2.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottleneck</strong>: slowest process in system</li>
<li><strong>Throughput</strong>: Number of items that leave system per time University</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong>: max throughput of system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forecasts">Forecasts</h3>
<p><strong>Principle 1:</strong> Always include in forecast derivation process</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand</li>
<li>Supply</li>
<li>Technology
<ul>
<li>new Technology</li>
<li>Learning &amp; Improvements</li>
</ul></li>
<li>cost of capacity</li>
<li>Strategic Uncertainty</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principle 2:</strong> Always include uncertainty by time bucket</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One number forecast: Simple, inexpensive, low-detail</li>
<li>Multiple scenario forecast: allows for wider range of cases</li>
<li>Full distribution: complex forecasting, best prediction capability</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Consensus based forecasting</strong> is the idea of asking several specialists for their opinion and let them come up with a number that everyone can agree on. This is dangerous, as it allows for human dynamics to nudge the number to something that does not resemble the actual statistical average of all individual estimates. Hence, it looses detail and information value.</p>
<h3 id="flexibility-categories">Flexibility Categories</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Mix Flexibility</strong>: Classic example is a 3D Printer. The ability to create several types of products / services with the same invest. Another example in the service environment would be a general consultant. The opposite would be someone highly specialised.</li>
<li><strong>Volume Flexibility</strong>: Allowing for (low cost) adaptation of the production rate, i.e. a low percentage of fixed costs per unit. A good example are the auto-scalling features of contemporary cloud services.</li>
<li><strong>New Product Flexibility</strong>: Ability of quickly incorporating new products into the chain and offering them to the market. One such example would be a company that runs a form of incubation lab in the software space. This lab would quickly experiment on possible new products and their viability in the market before incorporating them into the portfolio.</li>

<ul>
<li>If one produces too much, the produce must be stored</li>
<li>If one produces too little, the customers must waiting</li>
<li>If one has capacity but doesn’t use it until it is required, the resources must wait</li>
</ul>
<p>Scale economies allow for reduced marginal cost with increasing total number of items produced. This may not only be due to the spreading of fixed cost but also from bulk orders leading to material cost reduction, learning processes, efficiency improvements etc.</p>
<p><strong>Tools of the trade for Risk analysis</strong>: - Scenario analysis: worst, expected, best case 1. Determine Factors 2. Determine Scenarios 3. Assign probabilities 4. Estimate Cash Flow for each 5. Compute expected NPV - Decision Tree &amp; Real Option Analysis: sequential decisions, discrete results - Incorporates <em>decisions</em> in comparison to scenario analysis which expects a certain end result and then weighs the value of each. - Simulation: complex computational models which are part of another lecture</p>

</ul>
<p>There is a tradeoff point: the higher the service level of a company is set to be, the lower is the cost saving when using offshoring. At some point, it is more logical to use local sources, as shipping and safety stock costs negate all savings of the individual COGS.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8-strategic-risk-management-diversification-risk-pooling">Chapter 8: Strategic Risk Management: Diversification &amp; Risk Pooling</h2>
<h3 id="risk-pooling-of-demand-uncertainty">Risk Pooling of Demand Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Sharing the risk by aggregating supply/demand locations and pooling the customer demand. Let’s assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 centralized warehouse supplying iPhones to all of Germany</li>
<li>100 stores without cooperation, each having to supply their own region</li>
</ul>
<p>The differences in demand for separate regions require them to stock much more than they would need if they shared their safety stock pool. However, there are two disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>increased response time</li>
<li>increased shipping costs per unit</li>
</ul>
<p>So overall it can be said that in a market where: Individual shipping costs surcharges are low and response time is not elementary, centralized warehouses are rational. This can be seen with car dealers. Yes, they have cars on stock but mainly for demonstration purposes. A Toyota dealer doesn’t however store 10 identical models for customers to walk in and buy one.</p>
<h3 id="correlation-effects-on-risk-pooling">Correlation Effects on Risk Pooling</h3>
<p>Correlation Coefficients</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p = \frac{\text{covariance}}{\sigma_1\sigma_2} = \frac{E[(D_1-\mu_1)(D_2-\mu_2)]}{\sigma_1\sigma_2} \]</span></p>
<p>Now this obviously leads to covariance in between locations and, if demand is correlated, this needs to be taken into account. Statistics 101 so to speak.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sigma_{pool} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_1 + 2p\sigma_1\sigma_2 + \sigma^2_2} \le \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 \]</span></p>
<p>How effective is the pool? Well it depends on the correlation factor. if correlation is at -1 then it has the craziest effect as every missed sale is an additional sale somewhere else and the pool buffers this. A +1 correlation leads to no benefit at all.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{effectiveness} = 1 - \frac{\sigma_{pool}}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}\]</span></p>
<p><img src="images/pascalwhoop/19.png" /></p>

<p><img src="images/chovestadt/4.png" /></p>
<p>This is of course obvious to a rational person. The question is however, how much does the Flexibility improvements cost the company? A $ 2 Mio. costly ERP system doesn’t benefit a shopkeep that owns 4 pasta shops. So the ahead of time investment cost for such a flexibility increasing setup always needs to be weighed against the expected savings.</p>

<h3 id="paper-about-additive-manufacturing">11.3 Paper about Additive Manufacturing</h3>
<p>The paper discusses the chances and challenges of additive manufacturing for the global markets as well as for the economy of the US as a nation. It’s a predictive article, meaning it’s based on hypothesis and theories without proof but on educated guesses.</p>
<p>One major assumption the author makes and bases his arguments on is the assumption that AM is not suffering from scale economies or rather the lack of them due to low numbers of production. He argues that this leads to massive changes in the supply chains of most products and will affect everyone quiet strongly.</p>
<p><em>I argue that he does not once reason why the AM will not suffer from economies of scale. Some reasons why it should also suffer from EOS:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>fixed costs such as rent, insurance, machines (3D printers), staff will still exist</li>
<li>base materials for products will still have to be purchased –&gt; large shippments are still cheaper</li>
<li>large companies still have learning and, bargaining power and capacity utilization as an advantage</li>
</ul>
<p>The author partially argues against these points in later paragraphs. The arguments are partially valid but without any funding proof. The first point he also notes, the second one he argues is less relevant, as AM firms can buy base materials for all sorts of products instead of having to buy individual distinct items. Hence, they have EOS by being able to purchase in bulk for several different products. This however assumes other firms cannot buy at one supplier and get discounts even though they order “10% of everything”. It also assumes that competitors do not also produce from raw materials. If we were to talk e.g. about different bolts, screws and hinges, the TM manufacturers also produce these from raw materials and hence also purchase just one material in bulk.</p>
<p>The author also argues that learning and experience is less relevant for AM firms. I disagree, as the technology certainly hasn’t become simpler and hence, a highly skill workforce is still required. Also, AM firms don’t really compete with classic, mainly human based manufacturing but with highly automated processing plants. Hence, they compete with robotic assembly lines.</p>
<p>A tradeoff curve would be required for all these to see the <em>actual</em> differences in EOS. This probably requires repeated empiricical data.</p>
<p>Assuming small firms <em>can</em> adequately compete with large firms through the deployment of AM, the author makes an interesting point. He introduces a <strong>tradeoff between organzational costs and economies of scale.</strong></p>
<p>While the author introduces the idea of large firms adopting AM and then moving towards many small franchised firms close to the customer, the inherent conclusion still is that there needs to be a global network of raw material deliveries. The concept of the “platform economy” therefore goes hand in hand with the idea of many small companies as some platform is required to integrate their economic interactions.</p>
