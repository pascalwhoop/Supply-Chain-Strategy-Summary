## Information

To create this summary there are a few helpers to make work easier:

- running `npm install && npm start` will watch the desktop for new `.png` files and automatically copy them to the images folder.
    - new images will be numbered from 1,2,3,4,... all ending with the `.png` file type
- to build a pdf from the markdown one may use `npm run build-pdf`
    - please advise: `pandoc` as well as `latex` need to be installed on the system and available in the PATH env variable
- to build a html website from the markdown one may use `npm build`

To install pandoc and latex on Linux one may use:
`sudo apt install pandoc texlive-latex-base
To use math, just use the normal latex notation.

`\\( f(x) = 2x \\)` for inline \\( f(x) = 2x \\)

and for block size math
```
$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$
```
$$ f(x) = sin(x) $$
